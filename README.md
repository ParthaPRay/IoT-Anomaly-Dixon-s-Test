Anomaly detection in the smart application domain can significantly improve the quality
of data processing, especially when the size of a dataset is too small. Internet of Things (IoT) enables
the development of numerous applications where sensor-data-aware anomalies can affect the decision
making of the underlying system. In this paper, we propose a scheme: IoTDixon, which works on
the Dixon’s Q test to identify point anomalies from a simulated normally distributed dataset. The
proposed technique involves Q statistics, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and partitioning of a given
dataset into a specific data packet. The proposed techniques use Q-test to detect point anomalies. We
find that value 76.37 is statistically significant where P = 0.012 < α = 0.05, thus rejecting the null
hypothesis for a test data packet. In other data packets, no such significance is observed; thus, no
outlier is statistically detected. The proposed approach of IoTDixon can help to improve small-scale
point anomaly detection for a small-size dataset as shown in the conducted experiments.
